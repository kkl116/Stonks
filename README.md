# Stonks

------ Work in Progress! ------ 

A small sideproject to create a personal dashboard for stock analysis. The aim is to create a tool for fundamental analysis of stocks and learning to conduct these analysis on the way!
The base html, css and js of the dashboard comes from a bootstrap template, with some modifications to create a different look. The backend uses Flask. 
The main application is in the flask_app folder.
The html and css of the dashboard uses the template provided by https://www.creative-tim.com/.
