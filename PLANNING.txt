PLANNING 
features I want/need/need to learn about:
1. what are some KPIs for stocks? 
2. do I want a website for this or some kind of GUI?
3. What to visualize? 
4. ways to stream data continously and update visualizations live
5. single place to access multiple data sources
6. sentiment analysis? 

(Just Do 1 thing at a time! Take it slow, but build something that you'd find useful)

current TODO:
- after login should be another welcome page -- 
- profile pages - set sayyyy default currency and change account settings 

side TODO (nicer looking features in the future):

- learn how to write simple tests!
- write some macros to clean up layout.html
- bundle js and css to page loads faster? (process into minjs and mincss)
- watchlist page - group function

sections:

- Home (maybe just the live tracker there and brief summary for stock searches)
- About? (simple intro)
- Create account 
^ portfolio page 
^ watchlist 

analysis section:
- charts 
- news
- analyse 

COMPLETED:
- layout.html
- live chart that updates current price... although have to do something about 
storing quotes somewhere once market opens.
- see if you can restructure using blueprints
- password reset 
- email verification
- password reset ajax
- add git ignore to hide files such as db
- watchlist page - add function
- watchlist page - delete function
- change search to yfinance - can load up more information in one go / try dash to make interactive app embedded into flask
- delete button for tables in search
