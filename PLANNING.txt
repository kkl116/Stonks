PLANNING 
features I want/need/need to learn about:
1. what are some KPIs for stocks? 
2. do I want a website for this or some kind of GUI?
3. What to visualize? 
4. ways to stream data continously and update visualizations live
5. single place to access multiple data sources
6. sentiment analysis? 

(Just Do 1 thing at a time! Take it slow, but build something that you'd find useful)

current TODO:
- Portfolio page - setup the add and delete ticker system, then maybe add a little something extra like level of diversity or something
    - portfolio todos:
        -portfolio history
        -sell button
        -portfolio tags and sectors --------
- watchlistitems and portfolio items custom tags? (which goes into grouping function sort of)
- after login should be another welcome page -- 
- profile pages - set sayyyy default currency and change account settings 
- 404 error page 
- loading animation for adding tickers - 
add_notes button dynamically adding the notes row when toggled - 

side TODO (nicer looking features in the future):

- learn how to write simple tests!
- write some macros to clean up layout.html
- bundle js and css to page loads faster? (process into minjs and mincss)
- watchlist page - group function
- modify stockquotes so only fetching needed data? 


sections:

- Home (maybe just the live tracker there and brief summary for stock searches)
- About? (simple intro)
- Create account 
^ portfolio page 
^ watchlist 

analysis section:
- charts 
- news
- analyse 

COMPLETED:
- layout.html
- live chart that updates current price... although have to do something about 
storing quotes somewhere once market opens.
- see if you can restructure using blueprints
- password reset 
- email verification
- password reset ajax
- add git ignore to hide files such as db
- watchlist page - add function
- watchlist page - delete function
- change search to yfinance - can load up more information in one go / try dash to make interactive app embedded into flask
- delete button for tables in search
- create ajax template function
- fix portfolio system a little - if it's the same ticker then modify existing entry, not create a new one
- watchlist table items right now notes are considered a row (but not displayed) - consider changing it to 
- loading gif? -- bit trickier b/c it's waiting for server side to finish the functions - basically direct to loading route, then ajax to main page,
and refresh after the page is done loading
