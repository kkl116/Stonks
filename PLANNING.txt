PLANNING 
features I want/need/need to learn about:
1. what are some KPIs for stocks? 
2. do I want a website for this or some kind of GUI?
3. What to visualize? 
4. ways to stream data continously and update visualizations live
5. single place to access multiple data sources
6. sentiment analysis? 

(Just Do 1 thing at a time! Take it slow, but build something that you'd find useful)

current TODO:
- first start with basic visuaizations of historic price getting data from somewhere, 
then automatically visualizing it on a GUI? or webpage honestly but I feel building
a website is some insane effort '''

-if making website can think about django/flask - python web development framework..
-learn how to write simple tests!
